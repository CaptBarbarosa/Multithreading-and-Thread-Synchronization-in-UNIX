    Thread barriers are a thread synchonization data structure that stops all incoming threads at a particular line of code until some specified number of threads have arrived
    
    If we need to wait for a number of threads to complete so that the overall task can proceed then we use barrier synchronization.

    Assume a barrier waits for 3 threads. Assume that two threads have arrived. At this point the barrier stops execution of the threads till another thread comes.

    Example use: Let's say you are using an internet download manager (IDM) and downloading multiple files out of internet. IDM reports file download succesfull only after all threads downloads their files.
