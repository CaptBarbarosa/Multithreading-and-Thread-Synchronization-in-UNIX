    Unlike asynchronous cancellation, in the deferred cancellation the developer controls as to which points the thread is allowed to cancel. This points are called "Cancellation Points". Developer should select a cancellation point in which no variants, memory leaks or deadlocks occur.
    
    Deferred cancellation is used to handle the troubles associated with the asynchronous thread cancellation discussed in part 7.

    We set cancellation point with pthread_testcancel() function.
