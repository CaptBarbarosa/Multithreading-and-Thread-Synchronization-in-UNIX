Assume you have a huge software. You also multithreaded your software but they need to interchange some data. You can use some of the following techniques:
  1.) Sockets
  2.) Msg Queues
  3.) Pipes
  4.) Shared Memory
Even though these are usable, the recommended way for communication between threads is using callbacks and function pointers. Because they are a lot more faster. They don't actually require transfer of data, it doesn't require kernel attention.
