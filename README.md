## Introduction

Multithreading involves running multiple threads concurrently within a process to achieve parallelism and improve performance. Thread synchronization is crucial to avoid race conditions and ensure the correctness of data when multiple threads access shared resources.

## Course Content

This project is based on the following resources:
- Udemy Courses: 
  - "Part A - Multithreading & Thread Synchronization - Pthreads"
  - "Part B (ADVANCE) Multithreading Design Patterns (pthreads)"
- Codevault YouTube Channel
- Jacob Sorber YouTube Channel
- Neso Academy YouTube Channel
- Udacity YouTube Channel
