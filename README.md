# Multithreading and Thread Synchronization in UNIX

Welcome to the Multithreading and Thread Synchronization in UNIX repository! This project encompasses various concepts and implementations related to multithreading and thread synchronization using Pthreads in UNIX.

## About Multithreading and Thread Synchronization

Multithreading involves running multiple threads concurrently within a process to achieve parallelism and improve performance. Thread synchronization is crucial to avoid race conditions and ensure the correctness of data when multiple threads access shared resources.

### Course Content

This project is based on the "Part A - Multithreading & Thread Synchronization - Pthreads" course on Udemy. Here are the key topics covered:

1. **Getting Started With Multi-Threading** 
   - Introduction to multithreading concepts.
   - Creating and managing threads.

2. **Concurrency vs Parallelism**
   - Understanding the difference between concurrency and parallelism. (You can find this in my PDF notes)

3. **Joinable and Detached Threads**
   - Managing thread lifecycles: joinable and detached threads.

4. **Inter Thread Communication**
   - Methods for threads to communicate with each other. (You can find this in my PDF notes)

5. **Notification Chains**
   - Implementing notification chains for thread communication. (You can find this in my PDF notes)

6. **Thread Cancellation**
   - Asynchronous and deferred thread cancellation mechanisms.

7. **Listener Threads**
   - Creating and managing listener threads.

8. **Thread Synchronization**
   - Basic synchronization techniques to prevent race conditions.

9. **Deadlocks**
   - Understanding and preventing deadlocks.

10. **Condition Variables**
    - Using condition variables for thread synchronization.

11. **Dining Philosopher Problem**
    - Solving classic synchronization problems.

12. **Thread Barriers**
    - Implementing barriers to synchronize threads.

13. **Spin Locks**
    - Using spin locks for busy-wait synchronization.

14. **Semaphores**
    - Implementing semaphores for controlling access to resources.

15. **Recursive Mutexes/Locks**
    - Understanding and using recursive mutexes.

16. **Read-Write Locks**
    - Using read-write locks for efficient data access.

17. **Implementing Thread Safe Highly Concurrent CRUD Operations**
    - Ensuring thread safety in CRUD operations.

18. **Appendix: Glue Based Linked List**
    - Implementing a thread-safe linked list.
