    Assume that we have two threads. thread_1 and thread_2. They both are in operation and thread_1 tries to cancel thread_2. The thread_1 sends a cancellation request [CR(pthread_cancel)].
    
    Normally when a thread tries to cancel another threat, the cancellation request [CR(pthread_cancel())] is queued by OS. It isn't delivered immediately. The OS afterwards, looks for an opportunity to terminate thread T2. As said before this is normally. The threads are 

    But if a thread is set to deferred mode, the OS terminates the thread instantly (Asynchronous).

    Asynchronous cancellation allows the termination of threads instantly. But it be dangerous as it can be in the critical section
