#The GL at the beginning means "glued" and the reason why it is called thread is that it is a linked list and linked lists are like threads. Single and long.

#This "glue" concept is also aplicable to other data structures like trees, stacks etc. but here we will use doubly linked lists.

#include<stdio.h>


int main(){
    return 0;
