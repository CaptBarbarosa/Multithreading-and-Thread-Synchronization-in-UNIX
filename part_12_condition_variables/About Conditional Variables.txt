    Conditional variables are basically synchronization via sleep and wakeup signals and mutexes.

    Con. Var. + Mutex is what it takes to implement advanced thread synchronization scheme. 

    There is a phenomenon called spurious wake-ups. A thread waiting on a condition can be wake up without being explicitly signaled for several reasons such as hardware interrupts, race conditions or issues within the operating system scheduler.
